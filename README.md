# reactjs-lab 

A personal laboratory to experiment, test, and deepen my understanding of **React.js concepts** in isolation.  
This repository is focused on learning by doing — small, scoped examples instead of full applications.

## Tech Stack

- **React.js**
- **Vite** – lightning-fast **build tool and development server**
- **pnpm** – fast, disk-efficient package manager
- **TypeScript** (if applicable — remove if not used)

## Project Structure

The project is organized by **React concepts**, making it easy to explore and evolve each topic independently.

```
reactjs-lab/
├─ src/
│ ├─ components/ # Experiments and patterns related to React components
│ ├─ hooks/ # Custom hooks and hook-related concepts
│ └─ ...
├─ package.json
├─ pnpm-lock.yaml
└─ vite.config.ts
```
Each folder inside `src` represents a **specific React concept**, keeping examples focused, readable, and easy to extend.

## Getting Started

### Install dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### Start the development server
```bash
pnpm dev
```
The app will be available at:
```bash
http://localhost:5173
```

## Goals of This Repository

- Explore React fundamentals and advanced patterns
- Test ideas without production constraints
- Build intuition around hooks, components, and state management
- Serve as a personal reference and knowledge base
